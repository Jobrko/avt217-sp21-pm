      <li>1. Open XD</li>
      <li>2. Make a circle with a width of 1789 and a height of 1730, remove the border and make it a gray color to see what you are working with.</li>
      <li>3. Double click the circle and select the right anchor point. Delete that point and repeat until you have a half circle.</li>
      <li>4. Create another circle that is exactly half the height of the big circle. Make them the same color.</li>
      <li>5. Select both shapes and duplicate them. Proceed to change their color and flip the second shape so that the second shape is reflected over the x-axis.</li>
      <li>6. Bring the two shapes together so it almost forms a complete Yin Yang. Select the top circle, right click it and arrange, bring to front so that the circle is sitting on top of the sedond set of shapes.</li>
      <li>7. Create to more small circles and place them roughly in the middle of the bulging part of the halfs. Make sure that the colors of these circles of not the same color of the shape they are sitting in, rather the color of the shape the aren't.</li>
