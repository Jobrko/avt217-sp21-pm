      <p>I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics,
          and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable
          attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
          marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.
          As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who,
          from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and
          could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid
          his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.
      </p><br/>
      <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other
        prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.
        She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.
        Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased;
        and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by
        Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care;
        and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.
        Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.

      <p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
          There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.
          Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.
          There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age,
          for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured,
          but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her,
          as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
          benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.
      </p><br/>
      <p>During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their
        union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for
        her weakened frame. From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.
        I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine
        of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
        I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to
        good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep
         consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be
        imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all
        seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.
